by [Valerie Kraucunas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vkraucunas/)

### [Deployed Application](https://beerstatus-vkraucunas.firebaseapp.com/)

### Technologies Used
- React
- Stylus
- Webpack
- Storybook
- Jest, Enzyme

Node version used for development: v7.8.0

### My Approach
1. I started with `create-react-app` and ejected the scripts
1. I installed Redux, and react-redux to maintain a store in the project
1. For styling, I added Stylus, stylus-loader, and updated the webpack configs to use CSS Modules.
1. For testing, I added Storybook and Enzyme (create-react-app apps come with Jest as a test runner out of the box)
1. I set up the Firebase application hosting and hooked it up to my local repo before my first commit.

### Challenges I Faced
1. I typically get tripped up in the "setting up the build" step. This time I found several articles that addressed my questions as concerns as I went.

### Additional Steps
1. I selected a bottlecap svg from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=beer&i=11779), it was designed by Massimo Ippolito, IT
1. I used Coolors to select a color scheme for the project
